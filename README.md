# Electronic Guest Serving Network (EGON)
EGON is an Application to Manage easily Products like drinks, food and stuff. 
It also handles Guest orders which came directly from the Guests Smartphone. The Concept behind is, that every Guest is an 
indivdual but also a group of Guests are still a group and have a whole Bill for the Table.

To Check the the own bill and single bons (single credentials of bill), gives the Guest a full overview about the consumed products without asking a waiter. It also lets you find older bills from foreign visits tho find a meal or a drink again.
On the other hand waiters arent in charge anymore if its not necessariy. Every guest does his order, the system will collect them and show them to a main terminal for the waiters who can check them in and process.
